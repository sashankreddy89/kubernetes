Your ChatApp Frontend has been successfully deployed!

To access the frontend service within the cluster:

  kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-frontend

This will expose the service on port {{ .Values.frontend.service.port }} inside the cluster.

If you're using an Ingress (like ALB or NGINX), make sure it's configured to route traffic to this service.

You can also verify the frontend deployment:

  kubectl get pods -l app={{ .Release.Name }}-frontend

To monitor the autoscaling behavior:

  kubectl get hpa {{ .Release.Name }}-frontend-hpa
